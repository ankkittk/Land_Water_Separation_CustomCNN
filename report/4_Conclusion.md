# Conclusion

A deterministic CNN-based feature extraction framework was successfully implemented for land–water segmentation.

Key strengths:
- Explainable pipeline
- No training required
- Modular architecture
- Effective boundary visualization

Future improvements may include clustering-based threshold selection or multi-feature decision rules.
